# ImgPOD.NET
Image processing and Object detection tool for Windows.

PROJECT IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT.

.NET application for Windows for image processing and object detection. With application user is able to create image processing and object detection models with different parameters and view/save the results.

Project wraps around OpenCV Sharp library to provide user image processing functionality. The application is created using .NET WinForms project type.

So these functionalities are available:
- [X] Blur algorithm
- [X] Canny algorithm
- [X] Crop algorithm
- [X] Dilate algorithm
- [X] Mask/Absdiff algorithm
- [X] Threshold algorithm
- [X] Video loading
- [X] Save result images

Functionalities coming soon:
- [ ] Friendly GUI
- [ ] Object detection algorithm
- [ ] Design changes
- [ ] More image processing algorithms...

Example with result:
